```

## Code Quality Checker

The `code_check/check.sh` script provides automated code quality checks for Python, Bash, and Terraform files. It ensures consistent code formatting and identifies potential issues.

### Features

- **Python**: Uses `black` for code formatting
- **Bash**: Uses `shellcheck` for shell script validation
- **Terraform**: Uses `terraform fmt` for configuration formatting

### Requirements

- Python 3.x with pip3
- Homebrew (for installing dependencies)
- macOS (for Homebrew support)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd laughing-goggles-common-code
   ```

2. Make the check script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x code_check/check.sh
   ```

### Usage

Run the code quality checker:
```bash
./code_check/check.sh
```

The script will:
1. Check and install required dependencies if missing
2. Validate Python files using `black`
3. Check Bash scripts using `shellcheck`
4. Verify Terraform formatting using `terraform fmt`

### Dependencies

The script automatically installs these tools if missing:
- `black`: Python code formatter
- `shellcheck`: Shell script analyzer
- `terraform`: Infrastructure as Code tool

## Terraformer Utility

The `terraformer/extract_all.sh` script helps you import existing AWS infrastructure into Terraform configuration files. It uses the `terraformer` tool to automatically generate Terraform configurations for your AWS resources.

### Features

- Imports multiple AWS resources across all major regions
- Supports a wide range of AWS services including EC2, S3, RDS, and more
- Automatically installs required dependencies (terraform and terraformer)
- Interactive AWS profile selection
- Generates proper provider configuration

### Requirements

- macOS with Homebrew
- AWS credentials configured
- AWS CLI installed

### Usage

1. Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x terraformer/extract_all.sh
   ```

2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   ./terraformer/extract_all.sh
   ```

3. Follow the prompts to:
   - Enter your AWS profile name
   - Confirm when you want to run the terraformer import

The script will:
1. Check and install required dependencies
2. Initialize Terraform with the AWS provider
3. Import your AWS resources into Terraform configuration files

### Supported AWS Resources

The script supports importing a comprehensive list of AWS resources including:
- Compute (EC2, ECS, Lambda)
- Storage (S3, EBS)
- Database (RDS, DynamoDB)
- Networking (VPC, Route53)
- Security (IAM, KMS)
- And many more AWS services
